2. **Encryption**: Connection details are encrypted before being stored, using the cryptography library.
3. **Secure Password Input**: Passwords are never shown in plain text and are input securely.
4. **Keyring Support**: Optionally use your system's keyring for storing encryption keys.

However, please note that while we strive to implement best security practices, peepDB's security has not been verified by a third party. Users should exercise caution and follow general security best practices when using any tool that handles sensitive information.
