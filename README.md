**peepDB** is an open-source command-line tool and Python library designed for developers and database administrators who need a fast and efficient way to inspect their database tables without writing SQL queries. With support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB, peepDB is lightweight, secure, and incredibly easy to use.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-Database Support**: Works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB.
- **Quick Data Inspection**: View all tables or a specific table with a simple command.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line interface powered by Click.
- **Secure Local Storage**: Securely store database connection details with encryption on your local machine.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal footprint, designed for speed.
- **Formatted Output**: View data in a clean, formatted table or JSON format.
- **Pagination**: Efficiently handle large datasets by viewing data in manageable chunks.

## üì¶ Installation

You can install peepDB directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install peepdb
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

peepDB uses a command-based structure for easier and more intuitive use. Here are the main commands with examples:

### 1. Save Your Database Connection Details

```bash
peepdb save <connection_name> --db-type [mysql/postgres/mariadb] --host <host> --user <user> --database <database>
```

**Important Note on Password Handling:**
For security reasons, peepDB will prompt you for the password interactively rather than accepting it as a command-line argument. This prevents the password from being visible in your command history or to other users who might be able to see your screen.

Example:
```bash
peepdb save myapp_db --db-type mysql --host localhost --user root --database myapp
# You will be prompted to enter the password securely
```

### 2. List Saved Connections

```bash
peepdb list
```

Example output:
```
Saved connections:
- myapp_db (mysql)
- analytics_db (postgres)
```

### 3. View Tables

View all tables:
```bash
peepdb view <connection_name>
```

View a specific table:
```bash
peepdb view <connection_name> --table <table_name>
```

Example:
```bash
peepdb view myapp_db --table users
```

Output:
```
Table: users
+----+----------+----------------------+
| id | username |        email         |
+====+==========+======================+
|  1 | johndoe  | johndoe@example.com  |
|  2 | janedoe  | janedoe@example.com  |
+----+----------+----------------------+
Page 1 of 1 (Total rows: 2)
```

### 4. Pagination

Use pagination to handle large datasets:
```bash
peepdb view <connection_name> --table <table_name> --page <page_number> --page-size <rows_per_page>
```

Example:
```bash
peepdb view myapp_db --table users --page 2 --page-size 50
```

### 5. Choose Output Format

Get output in JSON format:
```bash
peepdb view <connection_name> --format json
```

Example:
```bash
peepdb view myapp_db --table users --format json
```

Output:
```json
{
  "users": {
    "data": [
      {"id": 1, "username": "johndoe", "email": "johndoe@example.com"},
      {"id": 2, "username": "janedoe", "email": "janedoe@example.com"}
    ],
    "page": 1,
    "total_pages": 1,
    "total_rows": 2
  }
}
```

### 6. Remove Saved Connections

Remove a specific connection:
```bash
peepdb remove <connection_name>
```

Remove all connections:
```bash
peepdb remove-all
```

## üîí Security

peepDB implements several security measures to protect your database connection details:

1. **Local Storage**: All connection details are stored locally on your machine, not on any remote servers.
2. **Encryption**: Connection details are encrypted before being stored, using the cryptography library.
3. **Secure Password Input**: Passwords are never shown in plain text and are input securely.
