## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Command-Line Interface

#### 1. Save Your Database Connection Details (Optional)

You can securely store your connection details for easier access:

```bash
peepdb <connection_name> --save --db-type [mysql/postgres/mariadb] --host <host> --user <user> --password <password> --database <database>
```

#### 2.  List Saved Connections

To view all saved database connections:

```bash
peepDB --list
```

#### 3. View All Tables or a Specific Table

To view all tables in the database:

```bash
peepDB <connection_name>
```

To view a specific table:

```bash
peepDB <connection_name> --table <table_name>
```

#### 4.  Removed Saved Connections

To remove a specific saved connection:

```bash
peepdb --remove <connection_name>
```
To remove all saved connection:

```bash
peepdb --remove-all
```
> **Note:** Both of these commands will ask for confirmation before proceeding with the removal.

### Examples

- **Save MySQL connection details:**

  ```bash
  peepdb myapp_db --save --db-type mysql --host localhost --user root --password mypassword --database myapp
  ```

- **View all tables in the saved MySQL database:**

  ```bash
  peepDB myapp_db
  ```

- **View a specific table:**

  ```bash
  peepDB myapp_db --table users
  ```

- **Use PostgreSQL without saving details:**

  ```bash
  peepdb analytics_db --save --db-type postgres --host localhost --user postgres --password mypassword --database analytics
  ```

### Python Library (Coming Soon)

You will also be able to use peepDB in your Python scripts:

```python
from peepdb.core import peep_db
```

## üîí Security

peepDB uses encryption to securely store your database connection details. The encryption key is stored in your user directory (~/.peepdb/key.key). Make sure to keep this key safe and do not share it.
