## üë®‚Äçüíª For Developers

Please refer to our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on setting up the development environment, running tests, and contributing to peepDB.

## üîí Security

peepDB implements several security measures to protect your database connection details:

1. **Local Storage**: All connection details are stored locally on your machine, not on any remote servers.
2. **Encryption**: Connection details are encrypted before being stored, using the cryptography library.
3. **Secure Password Input**: Passwords are never shown in plain text and are input securely.

However, please note that while we strive to implement best security practices, peepDB's security has not been verified by a third party. Users should exercise caution and follow general security best practices when using any tool that handles sensitive information.

The encryption key is stored in your user directory (~/.peepdb/key.key). Keep this key safe and do not share it.
